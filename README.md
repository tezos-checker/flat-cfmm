# Flat CFMM

CFMM between two tokens (FA1.2 / FA2 each) using the isoutility curve U(x,y) = (x+y)^8 - (x-y)^8
This curve has the benefit of being extremely flat around x = y, at which point dx U / dy U = -1.
This makes it suitable to create a CFMM between two assets which ought to be pegged to one another.
